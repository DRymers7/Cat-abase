## Description ##
This is an example data production server designed to serve newly created example pets to a kafka stream. That 
stream will be subscribed to by other backend microservices in the application to emulate what it would look like
to have such a stream of data coming from existing animal shelters/petfinder. This is important for proof of concept.
